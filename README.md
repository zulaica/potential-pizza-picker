Pizzeria serves a variety of pizza pies, each with a distinct name and its own unique set of toppings. No two pizzas are identical, but any number of pizzas may share similar toppings.

The menu only lists the name of each pizza. A customer can select a topping they do not want on their pizza in order to narrow down the options available.

- Each pizza has a name and a list of toppings.
- User can specify a topping they do not want on their pizza from the dropdown.
- After selecting a topping, the list of pizzas updates to indicate which pizzas do not contain the topping specified by the user.
- The user may click on one of the available pizzas to see the list of toppings for that item.
